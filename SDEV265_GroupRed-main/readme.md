# Oregon Trail with Python(s)

Welcome to the Oregon Trail game implemented in Python! This game puts you in the shoes of a pioneer traveling along the Oregon Trail, trying to make it to the next checkpoint before running out of food. Your decisions will determine the outcome of your journey.

## How to Play

1. **Choose Your Character**: At the beginning of the game, you have the option to pick one of three characters: Banker, Merchant, or Farmer. Each character has different starting money and skills. The character selection affects your odds of success in special events that may occur during the game.

2. **Manage Your Resources**: Money and food are your main resources in this game. Money is used to purchase food or special services such as ferry rides. Food is consumed each day, and if you run out of food, your journey will end. You can buy food at certain checkpoints using your money.

3. **Travel and Hunt**: Each day, you have the choice to either travel or hunt for food. Traveling progresses your journey but consumes food. Hunting allows you to gather additional food but does not present any other scenarios. The distance to the next checkpoint decreases randomly with each traveled day.

4. **Encounter Scenarios**: As you travel, you will encounter various scenarios randomly. Some scenarios require you to make decisions that affect the time it takes to reach the next checkpoint or your food rations. Special events may also occur based on your character selection and skills. Success in these scenarios depends on randomized outcomes and your character's abilities.

5. **Reach Checkpoints**: Your ultimate goal is to reach the next checkpoint before running out of food. There are three checkpoints between the start and finish, with a predetermined number of rivers to cross. Manage your resources wisely and overcome the challenges to complete the journey.
